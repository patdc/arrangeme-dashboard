# Arrangeme Advanced Dashboard

## Introduction

Arrangeme offers a platform where artists and musicians can sell their sheet music. While the platform is feature-rich, the built-in dashboard may sometimes not provide a deep dive into the sales data that users might be interested in. Recognizing this, the Arrangeme Advanced Dashboard was developed using Angular, SCSS, and HTML. It provides an enhanced perspective into your sales, ensuring you get the most out of your data.
